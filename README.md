# remove-powered

This package provides middleware for Express.js to remove the X-Powered-By header. By default, Express sets the X-Powered-By header to "Express". This can potentially be exploited, though using this middleware does not entirely obscure the use of Express.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @keels/remove-powered --save
```

## Usage

Use this package as Express middleware.

```
const rp = require('@keels/remove-powered');

app.use(rp.removePowered);
```
